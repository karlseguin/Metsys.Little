h2. Metsys.Little

Metsys.Little is a lightweight .NET binary serializer with a focus on compactness and speed. Given the following object:

@var user = new User
	   {
               Id = 433,
               Name = "Goku"
    	       Enabled = true,
	       Initial = null,
               Description = null,
            };@

Metsys.Little will serialize this to a 13 bytes. The built-in BinaryFormatter will take 400 bytes. The object created in the IntegrationTests.NestedTypesWithCollectionOfObjects method serializes to 74 bytes - the BinaryFormatter is over 900.

This is achieved without any cpu-intensive compression or other fancy tricks.

h3. Limitations

Metsys.Little supports built-in value types (int/short/long/float/double/decimal/byte/char/enums/datetime) and strings. It also supports a number of IEnumerable's - with the main exception being Dictionary types (non-generic types aren't likely to work either).

The type must have a default constructor - it can be private.

h3. Usage

Use the Serializer.Serialize method to turn your object into a byte array:
@var data = Serializer.Serialize(new User{...});@

Use the Deserializer.Deserialize method to turn your byte array (or stream) back into your object:
@var user = Deserializer.Deserialize(data);@
